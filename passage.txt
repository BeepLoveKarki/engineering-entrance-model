Read the following passage and give the answer of the following question
At a time when we are enjoying longer, more healthful lives, ominous headlines announces: 'Researchers Tie Aluminium to Alsheimer's Disease' and 'Coffee linked to Cholesterol Rise'. As a result of alarming and something ambiguous bulletins, worriers often become major threats, and speculations about disease prevention become 'proven' curs. Par to the problem is that the media often trumpet stionable research findings as major medical breakthroughs. In 1985, three French scientists told reporters at a press that the drug cyclosporine appeared to halt the growth of the AIDS virus. They asked the announcement on their observation of two AIDS patients treated for eight days. Never mind that no actual study had been done; for the media, the announcement was enough, and the story became front-page news around the world. Unfortunately, one of the patients died within days. Cyclosporine was no miracle cure.
